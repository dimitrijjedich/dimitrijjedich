![MySQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/-MySQL-4479A1?logo=mysql&logoColor=white&style=plastic)
![GraphQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/-GraphQL-E10098?logo=graphql&logoColor=white&style=plastic)

I specialize in backend development with a focus on Laravel with a MySQL setup and GraphQl as API layer.

### Currently learning

![PHP](https://img.shields.io/badge/-PHP-8993BE?logo=php&logoColor=white&style=plastic)

While I am experienced with both Go and PHP, I am continually learning and improving my skills in these areas. Go offers a refreshing change from Laravel, while PHP's fundamentals help deepen my understanding and expertise within the Laravel framework.

![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/-React-61DAFB?logo=react&logoColor=white&style=plastic)

Lately, I've been exploring Inertia.js and React as part of my journey into frontend development. My goal is to broaden my skills and get a better understanding of how frontend and backend interact, helping me improve communication and collaboration with frontend developers when planning, designing, and building APIs.

## 🚀 Projects & Work

Currently, I am working on implementing a variety of algorithms in PHP and Go. At the moment, my focus is on sorting algorithms and data structures, particularly trees. These are key concepts I'm exploring to deepen my understanding of algorithm design and optimization. In the near future, I plan to shift my focus to implementing cryptography algorithms, further expanding my expertise in both PHP and Go.

### 📌 Featured Projects

- **[PHP algorithms](https://github.com/FaSe22/phpalgorithms)**  
  The previously mentioned algorithms implementations in PHP

- **[Go algorithms](https://github.com/dimitrijjedich/go-algorithms)**  
  The same for the Go programming language

### [📑 Documentation](https://github.com/dimitrijjedich/Documentation/)

I’m also working on developing the habit of documenting and tracking the different problems I encounter and solve. While this repository is currently empty, I plan to populate it with solutions over time.
